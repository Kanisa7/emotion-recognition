Facial Emotion Recognition
This project focuses on developing a facial emotion recognition system using deep learning techniques. The system is capable of identifying and classifying human emotions from facial expressions in real-time. It leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on a dataset of labeled facial images to predict emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and neutral.

Features
Real-time Emotion Detection: The system captures live video feed from the webcam and performs real-time emotion detection.
Pre-trained Model: Utilizes a pre-trained CNN model fine-tuned on a comprehensive facial emotion dataset.
Data Augmentation: Employs data augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization and robustness.
Visualization: Displays the detected emotion along with the confidence score on the video feed.
